Installing Raspberry Pi OS on a Compute Module with Internal eMMC

    Prepare the Compute Module:
        Insert the Compute Module into the IO board.
        Place a jumper wire on the nRPI_BOOT pins (J4) on the IO board. This puts the Compute Module into USB boot mode.

    Connect to Your Computer:
        Use a USB cable to connect the IO Board’s USB slave port (J15) to your computer.

    Enable USB Boot:
        On your computer, run the following command to initialize the Compute Module’s eMMC:

        bash

    sudo rpiboot

    This command will expose the eMMC as a USB storage device on your computer.

Install Raspberry Pi Imager:

    Update your system and install Raspberry Pi Imager:

    bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y rpi-imager

Flash the OS:

    Launch Raspberry Pi Imager from your applications menu or terminal.
    Choose OS: Select "Use Custom" to select your preferred OS image (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS or your custom image).
    Edit Settings: Optionally, edit the settings to configure things like Wi-Fi, SSH, or even add a custom splash screen.
    Select Storage: Choose the eMMC storage that appeared as a USB device after running rpiboot.
    Click Write to flash the OS onto the Compute Module's internal eMMC.

Complete Setup:

    Once the flashing process is complete, remove the jumper wire from the nRPI_BOOT pins.
    Reboot the Compute Module, and it will boot from the internal eMMC with the newly installed OS.
